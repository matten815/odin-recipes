        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>It's so easy to make your own cold-brewed coffee. If you make brewed coffee regularyly, you have everything you need. Just keep a few glass jars or bottles on hand for storing the cold-brewed coffee, and you can have a cup any time you want.</p>

        <ul><h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <li>Freshly coarse-ground beans</li>
            <li>Glass jar</li>
        </ul>

        <ol><h2>Steps</h2>
            <li>Put freshly coarse-ground beans into any kind of container (glass is usually best). Use your favorite roast, but make sure its ground very coarsely so it won't cloud the water.</li>
            <li>Gently pour in cold, filtered water at a ratio of 4-to-1 (for example, 4 cups water for 1 cup grounds).</li>
            <li>Stir gently to make sure all grounds are wet and cover container with plastic wrap.</li>
            <li>Let it sit at room temperature for 12 to 24 hours. Taste it occasionally and discard the grounds when the coffee hits your sweet spot.</li>
        </ol>
